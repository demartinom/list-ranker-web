# **THIS IS A DEFUNCT PROJECT**
  
# List Ranker Web Application
### This project was built using Go on the backend and javascript on the frontend. A websocket is used to allow the two to communicate with each other.

#### I decided to restart the project using an api to have the two communicate with each other, as a websocket has proven to be not very useful for the scope of this project. The api version of this project can be found [here](https://github.com/demartinom/list-ranker-v2).
